# Human_Activity_Recognition

Checked whether the person used correct form in the workout which had the potential to prevent injuries. Dataset was divided into training set and testing set. Random forest was used for classification into classes A to E. The person was classified into class A if the form was correct. Classified into Class B if the person is doing a particular the mistake in the form and subsequently into other classes

Tasks done :
1) Cleaned the dataset by removing irrelevant variables
2)Used subsample set of 1000 rows and implemented various machine learning algorithms on our model
3)Tested Na√Øve Bayes, Generalized Boosting Models & Random Forests
4)Determined that Random Forests had the highest accuracy when implemented
5)Accuracy of the cross-validation using the Random Forest algorithm was optimal, with an accuracy of 86.2%
6)Used Random Forest to predict the remaining data and was done with 99.27% accuracy
